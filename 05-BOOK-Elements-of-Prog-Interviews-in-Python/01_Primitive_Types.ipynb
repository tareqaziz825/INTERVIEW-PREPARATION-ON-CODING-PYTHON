    "### 1. What is a \"shift\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In programming, a **shift** moves the bits of a number left or right.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - \\( 5 \\) in binary is `0101`.\n",
    "  - Shifting left by 1 → `1010` (which is 10).\n",
    "  - Shifting right by 1 → `0010` (which is 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Signed vs Unsigned shift\n",
    "\n",
    "- In many languages (like Java, C++), integers have a **fixed size** (e.g., 32 bits).\n",
    "- When shifting right:\n",
    "  - **Signed shift (arithmetic shift)** keeps the sign bit (the leftmost bit that says if the number is negative).\n",
    "  - **Unsigned shift (logical shift)** fills with zeros instead, ignoring the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Why Python is different\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python integers are **not fixed size**. They can grow as big as needed (infinite precision).\n",
    "- That means Python doesn’t really have a \"sign bit\" in the same sense as 32-bit or 64-bit integers.\n",
    "- So when you do a right shift in Python (`>>`), it **always behaves like a signed shift**:\n",
    "  - Negative numbers stay negative.\n",
    "  - Positive numbers stay positive.\n",
    "- There’s **no separate \"unsigned shift\" operator** in Python, because the concept of \"unsigned\" only makes sense when numbers are stored in fixed-size boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Easy way to think about it\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Java/C++: numbers live in fixed-size boxes → shifting can be signed or unsigned.\n",
    "- In Python: numbers live in **bottomless boxes** → only signed shifting makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when people say \"Python doesn’t have unsigned shift because integers have infinite precision,\" they mean:  \n",
    "Python doesn’t need to worry about fixed-size overflow or sign bits, so it only supports the \"normal\" shift (`>>` and `<<`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers in Python are arbitrary precision**: they can grow as large as needed, not limited to 32 or 64 bits.\n",
    "- Shifts in Python:\n",
    "  - `x << n` → shifts bits left, always fine.\n",
    "  - `x >> n` → shifts bits right, but **preserves the sign** for negative numbers.\n",
    "- Because Python doesn’t have a fixed \"sign bit,\" there’s **no separate unsigned shift operator**.  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = -8\n",
    "  print(x >> 2)   # → -2\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Explanation: Python keeps the number negative, instead of filling with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Java\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers are fixed size** (e.g., `int` = 32 bits, `long` = 64 bits).\n",
    "- Shifts in Java:\n",
    "  - `>>` → **signed right shift** (arithmetic shift). Keeps the sign bit.\n",
    "  - `>>>` → **unsigned right shift** (logical shift). Fills with zeros.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  int x = -8;          // binary: 1111111111111000\n",
    "  System.out.println(x >> 2);   // → -2 (signed shift)\n",
    "  System.out.println(x >>> 2);  // → 1073741822 (unsigned shift)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Notice how `>>>` produces a huge positive number, because the sign bit is replaced with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 C++\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers are also fixed size** (commonly 32 or 64 bits).\n",
    "- Shifts in C++:\n",
    "  - `>>` → behavior depends on whether the type is signed or unsigned:\n",
    "    - For **unsigned types** (`unsigned int`), right shift is logical (fills with zeros).\n",
    "    - For **signed types** (`int`), right shift is usually arithmetic (keeps sign), but technically implementation-defined.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```cpp\n",
    "  int x = -8;\n",
    "  cout << (x >> 2);          // → -2 (signed shift, arithmetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "  unsigned int y = 8;\n",
    "  cout << (y >> 2);          // → 2 (unsigned shift, logical)\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, **you don’t need to worry about unsigned shifts** because integers don’t overflow and don’t have a fixed sign bit.\n",
    "- If you ever need \"unsigned-like behavior,\" you can simulate it by **masking with a bitmask** (e.g., `x & 0xFFFFFFFF` for 32-bit behavior).\n",

    "Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) **without using the multiplication operator (`*`) or division operator (`/`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are only allowed to use:\n",

    "- Bitwise operators (`<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`)\n",

    "**Hint:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- First learn how to **add using bitwise operations**.\n",
    "- Then implement multiplication as repeated \"shift-and-add.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition without `+`:**\n",
    "   - Use bitwise XOR (`^`) to add bits without carry.\n",
    "   - Use bitwise AND (`&`) + left shift (`<<`) to compute the carry.\n",
    "   - Repeat until carry = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - `5 (0101)` + `3 (0011)`\n",
    "   - XOR → `0110` (6), Carry → `0010` (2).\n",
    "   - Add again → `0110 ^ 0010 = 0100` (4), Carry → `1000` (8).\n",
    "   - Continue until carry = 0 → result = 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiplication without `*`:**\n",
    "   - Think of binary multiplication like grade-school multiplication:\n",
    "     - If the lowest bit of `y` is `1`, add `x` to result.\n",
    "     - Shift `x` left (like multiplying by 2).\n",
    "     - Shift `y` right (like dividing by 2).\n",
    "   - Repeat until `y = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly how processors implement multiplication internally when hardware multipliers aren’t available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Python Solution\n",

    "    while b != 0:\n",
    "        carry = a & b\n",
    "        a = a ^ b\n",
    "        b = carry << 1\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "    result = 0\n",
    "    while y > 0:\n",

    "            result = add(result, x)\n",
