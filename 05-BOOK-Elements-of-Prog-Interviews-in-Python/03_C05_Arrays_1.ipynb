    "🔹 The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arrays have **fixed size** once created.\n",
    "- If the array is full and you want to insert a new element, you can’t just add it — you need more space.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 The Solution: Resizing\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the array is full, allocate a **new, larger array** (say, double the size).\n",
    "- Copy all elements from the old array into the new one.\n",
    "- Insert the new element.\n",
    "\n",
    "This copying step is expensive because it takes **O(n)** time (where ``n` is the number of elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Worst-Case vs. Average Case\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst-case insertion time**:  \n",
    "  When resizing happens, you must copy all elements → **O(n)**.\n",
    "- **Average-case insertion time**:  \n",
    "  Resizing doesn’t happen every time. Most insertions are just placing the element in the next free slot → **O(1)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why Average Time is Constant\n",
    "Let’s say we **double the array size** each time it fills:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with size 1 → resize to 2 → resize to 4 → resize to 8 → etc.\n",
    "- Each resize requires copying all existing elements, but resizing happens **less and less frequently** as the array grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insert 1 element → no resize.\n",
    "- Insert 2nd element → resize (copy 1 element).\n",
    "- Insert 3rd element → resize (copy 2 elements).\n",
    "- Insert 5th element → resize (copy 4 elements).\n",
    "- Insert 9th element → resize (copy 8 elements).\n",
    "- And so on…\n",
    "\n",
    "Total work after `n` insertions ≈ `2n` copies.  \n",
    "So the **amortized cost per insertion** = `frac{2n}{n} = O(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resizing is costly, but rare.\n",
    "- By growing the array by a **constant factor (like doubling)**, the average insertion time stays constant.\n",
    "- This is called **amortized analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In short:  \n",
    "Even though resizing costs **O(n)**, spreading that cost across many cheap insertions makes the **average insertion time O(1)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 The **average (amortized) insertion time** in a dynamic array is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Key Idea: **Doubling Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dynamic array grows by **doubling its size** whenever it runs out of space.\n",
    "- Resizing requires copying all existing elements into the new array.\n",
    "- Although copying is costly, it happens **less frequently** as the array grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example Trace\n",
    "Let’s walk through insertions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Insertion | Resize? | Elements Copied |\n",
    "| --------- | ------- | --------------- |\n",
    "| 1st       | No      | 0               |\n",
    "| 2nd       | Yes     | 1               |\n",
    "| 3rd       | Yes     | 2               |\n",
    "| 4th       | No      | 0               |\n",
    "| 5th       | Yes     | 4               |\n",
    "| 6th–8th   | No      | 0               |\n",
    "| 9th       | Yes     | 8               |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: copying happens at **powers of 2** (2, 4, 8, 16, …).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Total Work After `n` Insertions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each resize copies all current elements.\n",
    "- So total copies = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + dots + n/2).\n",
    "- This is a **geometric series**:  \n",
    "  [\n",
    "  1 + 2 + 4 + dots + (n/2) = approx n\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "- Plus the actual (n) insertions themselves → about (2n) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Amortized Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total work ≈ `2n`.\n",
    "- Average per insertion = (2n / n) = 2 = O(1).\n",
    "- Meaning: **most insertions are cheap (just place the element)**, and the occasional expensive resize is “spread out” across all insertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Intuition\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resizing is rare but costly.\n",
    "- The bigger the array, the longer until the next resize.\n",
    "- The cost of resizing gets “diluted” over many cheap insertions.\n",
    "- That’s why the **amortized cost is constant**.\n",

    "You are given an array of integers.  \n",
    "Reorder the array so that all **even numbers appear first**, followed by all **odd numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraint: You must solve this **in-place** (without allocating extra storage, i.e., `O(1)` additional space).\n",
    "- Hint: Use the fact that arrays allow efficient operations at both ends. Partition the array into three regions: **Even**, **Unclassified**, and **Odd**. Initially, the entire array is Unclassified. As you iterate, move elements into the Even or Odd regions using swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is essentially a **partitioning problem**, similar to the partition step in quicksort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain two pointers:\n",
    "  - `next_even` → the index where the next even number should go.\n",

    "- Initially:\n",
    "  - `next_even = 0`\n",
    "  - `next_odd = len(A) - 1`\n",
    "- While `next_even < next_odd`:\n",
    "  - If `A[next_even]` is even → it’s already in the correct region, so move `next_even` forward.\n",
    "  - If `A[next_even]` is odd → swap it with `A[next_odd]` (since odds belong at the end), then move `next_odd` backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evens accumulate at the front.\n",
    "- Odds accumulate at the back.\n",

    "When integers are stored as arrays of digits (like `[1,2,3]` for 123), you often need to process them starting from the **least significant digit (LSD)**. Since the LSD is at the **end of the array**, you have two main strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 1: Process from the Back (using indices)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simply iterate **backward** through the array.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Add 1 to a number stored as an array of digits\n",
    "def add_one(digits):\n",
    "    carry = 1\n",
    "    # Start from the last index (LSD)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why `carry = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variable carry represents the extra value we need to add to the digits.\n",
    "- Since the problem is specifically “add 1”, we initialize carry = 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "✅ Here we loop from the back (`len(digits)-1` down to `0`), which naturally handles LSD first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 2: Reverse the Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it’s easier to **reverse the array** so the LSD comes first. Then you can process it with a normal forward loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_one_reverse(digits):\n",
    "    digits.reverse()  # LSD is now at index 0\n",
    "    carry = 1\n",
    "    for i in range(len(digits)):\n",
    "        new_val = digits[i] + carry\n",

    "- **Process from the back** → efficient, no extra operations, good when you’re comfortable with reverse indexing.\n",

    "   ```python\n",

    "### 🔹 Why It’s Powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concise: One line can reverse, rotate, or extract subarrays.\n",
    "- Flexible: Works with positive/negative indices and steps.\n",
    "- Safe: Never throws errors for out-of-range indices (it just stops at boundaries).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is a List Comprehension?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **list comprehension** is a compact way to build lists in Python.  \n",
    "It combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input sequence** → the data you’re iterating over.\n",
    "2. **Iterator** → the variable that takes values from the sequence.\n",
    "3. **Optional condition** → filter elements.\n",
    "4. **Expression** → what to put in the new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "General form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in sequence if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Basic Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Squares of numbers 0–5\n",
    "[x**2 for x in range(6)]\n",
    "# → [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Squares of even numbers only\n",
    "[x**2 for x in range(6) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "# → [0, 4, 16]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x**2` → expression (square of x).\n",
    "- `for x in range(6)` → iterator.\n",
    "- `if x % 2 == 0` → condition (only evens).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Multiple Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can nest loops, which is useful for Cartesian products or flattening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Cartesian product\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = [1, 3, 5]\n",
    "B = ['a', 'b']\n",
    "[(x, y) for x in A for y in B]\n",
    "# → [(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (5, 'a'), (5, 'b')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Flatten a 2D list\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]\n",
    "[x for row in L for x in row]\n",
    "# → ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Nested Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also nest comprehensions to apply transformations row by row.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "[[x**2 for x in row] for row in A]\n",
    "# → [[1, 4, 9], [16, 25, 36]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outer comprehension iterates over rows.\n",
    "- Inner comprehension squares each element in the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Why Use List Comprehensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concise**: One line instead of multiple loops.\n",
    "- **Readable**: Easier to understand than `map()` + `filter()` + `lambda`.\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Supports conditions, multiple loops, and nesting.\n",

    "🔹 🔹 🔹 **nested loops in list comprehensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 General Rule: \n",
    "A list comprehension with multiple `for` clauses is equivalent to **nested `for` loops** written in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for var1 in iterable1 for var2 in iterable2 ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the **leftmost loop** (`for var1 in iterable1`).\n",
    "2. For each value of `var1`, run the **next loop** (`for var2 in iterable2`).\n",
    "3. Continue nesting until all loops are exhausted.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the `expression` for each combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example 1: Cartesian Product\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = [1, 3, 5]\n",
    "B = ['a', 'b']\n",
    "[(x, y) for x in A for y in B]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = []\n",
    "for x in A:          # outer loop\n",
    "    for y in B:      # inner loop\n",
    "        result.append((x, y))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- First `x = 1`, then `y = 'a'` → `(1, 'a')`\n",
    "- Still `x = 1`, then `y = 'b'` → `(1, 'b')`\n",
    "- Next `x = 3`, repeat inner loop → `(3, 'a')`, `(3, 'b')`\n",
    "- Next `x = 5`, repeat inner loop → `(5, 'a')`, `(5, 'b')`\n",
    "\n",
    "So it generates **all combinations** (Cartesian product).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example 2: Flatten a 2D List\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]\n",
    "[x for row in L for x in row]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "result = []\n",
    "for row in L:        # outer loop\n",
    "    for x in row:    # inner loop\n",
    "        result.append(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- First `row = ['a', 'b', 'c']` → adds `'a', 'b', 'c'`\n",
    "- Next `row = ['d', 'e', 'f']` → adds `'d', 'e', 'f'`\n",
    "\n",
    "So the nested comprehension **flattens** the 2D list into a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think of **reading left to right**: each `for` adds another level of nesting.\n",
    "- The **expression at the front** is evaluated once for every full path through the loops.\n",
    "- This is why Cartesian products and flattening are natural fits for nested comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Summary**: Multiple `for` clauses in a list comprehension behave like nested loops. The leftmost loop runs first, and for each of its values, the next loop runs, and so on. The expression is evaluated for every combination, producing results like Cartesian products or flattened lists.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Convert** lists of tuples into dictionaries directly.\n",
    "- **Transform values** while building.\n",
    "- **Filter entries** based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "They’re concise, readable, and ideal for data transformation tasks.\n",
