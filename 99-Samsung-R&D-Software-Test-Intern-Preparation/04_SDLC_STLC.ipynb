    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "SDLC is the **entire software development process** from initial requirement gathering to final deployment and maintenance. It includes **planning, designing, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance**. SDLC ensures that software is delivered on time, within budget, and meets quality standards.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Phases of SDLC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Requirement Gathering & Analysis**\n",
    "   - Understand what the client or user wants.\n",
    "   - Document functional and non-functional requirements.\n",
    "   - Tools/techniques: Interviews, questionnaires, use-case analysis, `SRS (Software Requirement Specification)`.\n",
    "   - `Output: SRS Document`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feasibility Study**\n",
    "   - Check if the project is `technically`, `economically`, and `operationally` feasible.\n",
    "   - `Output: Feasibility Report`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **System Design**\n",
    "   - Convert requirements into a design plan.\n",
    "   - `Two` levels:\n",
    "     - **High-Level Design (HLD):** System architecture, modules, database design, technology stack.\n",
    "     - **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Detailed logic of each module, pseudo code, interface designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implementation / Coding**\n",
    "   - Actual development/coding of the software based on design documents.\n",
    "   - Best practices: Follow coding standards, version control (Git), code reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Testing (Part of SDLC)**\n",
    "   - Ensure the software is working as per requirements.\n",
    "   - Can include `manual` testing, `automated` testing, `unit` testing, `integration` testing, `system` testing, `acceptance` testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deployment**\n",
    "   - Move software to production environment.\n",
    "   - Can be done in stages (alpha, beta, or full rollout).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Maintenance**\n",
    "   - Fix bugs that appear in production.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phases of STLC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Requirement Analysis**\n",
    "   - Study requirements from a testing perspective.\n",
    "   - Identify testable requirements and prepare **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**.\n",
    "   - Decide on types of testing needed (functional, non-functional).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Planning**\n",
    "   - Prepare a **Test Plan**: scope, objectives, resources, schedules, risks, entry/exit criteria.\n",
    "   - Decide testing tools and environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Case Design**\n",
    "   - Write **test cases and test scripts** based on requirements.\n",
    "   - Include test data preparation.\n",
    "   - Peer review test cases for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test Environment Setup**\n",
    "   - Prepare hardware, software, network, and data for testing.\n",
    "   - Ensure environment replicates production as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test Execution**\n",
    "   - Execute test cases in the prepared environment.\n",
    "   - Log **defects/bugs** in a `defect tracking tool` (like `JIRA`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Defect Reporting & Tracking**\n",
    "   - Report defects clearly with steps to reproduce.\n",
    "   - Track defects until they are resolved and retested.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test Closure**\n",
    "   - Evaluate test coverage, summarize defects, and lessons learned.\n",
    "   - Prepare `Test Closure Report`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- STLC **starts from requirement analysis for testing** and ends with closure after execution and reporting.\n",
