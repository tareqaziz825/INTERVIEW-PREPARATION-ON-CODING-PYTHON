Based strictly on your resume and your target (Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh – Software/AI role), here are the **5 most common interview questions with strong, customized answers tailored for you.**\n",

    "\n",
    "“My name is Mohammod Tareq Aziz. I recently completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science from BRAC University with a CGPA of 3.35. My academic focus has been on machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my thesis, I worked on a context-aware zero-shot video anomaly detection system where I combined TimeSformer-based spatiotemporal modeling with CLIP-based semantic alignment. The system achieved 84.5% ROC-AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset and outperformed existing pure zero-shot baselines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, I also worked on a machine learning research project analyzing blue-light blocking glasses using spectrophotometric data, where KNN achieved an R² score of 0.914.\n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches, and I’m particularly interested in building scalable and efficient AI systems. I’m now looking to start my professional journey where I can contribute to impactful R&D work while continuously learning.”\n",

    "### 2️⃣ “Why Samsung R&D Bangladesh?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am particularly interested in Samsung R&D Bangladesh because it is one of the few companies in the country that truly focuses on research-driven software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also appreciate Samsung’s global impact. Working here would allow me to contribute to products used worldwide while learning from experienced engineers in a structured R&D environment.\n",

    "Additionally, Samsung values innovation, optimization, and real-world deployment — which connects well with my thesis work on both advanced research models and lightweight deployment systems.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ “Explain Your Thesis in Simple Terms.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“My thesis focuses on detecting abnormal activities in surveillance videos without training the model on abnormal examples. Normally, anomaly detection systems require labeled abnormal data, but anomalies are rare and diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I built a zero-shot anomaly detection system that learns only from normal behavior. It uses a transformer-based spatiotemporal model to understand motion patterns and CLIP-based semantic alignment to match video features with contextual descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the video deviates from learned normal motion patterns or doesn’t align semantically with the scene context, the system flags it as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach improves generalization and achieved 84.5% ROC-AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ “What Was Your Biggest Technical Challenge?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“In my thesis, one major challenge was balancing semantic alignment and temporal prediction. Initially, the model produced high false positives because semantic alignment was overly sensitive to small deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, I implemented a context-gating mechanism and carefully balanced the alignment loss and predictive loss using weighted combination. I also conducted ablation studies to identify which components improved performance the most.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ “Why Should We Hire You?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I believe I’m a good fit because I combine research understanding with practical implementation skills. I have hands-on experience with PyTorch, Transformers, CNNs, and ML pipelines. I’ve worked on both high-level research models and lightweight deployment systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond technical skills, I’m comfortable reading research papers, conducting experiments, and optimizing models — which is important in an R&D environment.\n",

    "I’m highly motivated, eager to learn, and ready to contribute to real-world engineering problems while continuously improving myself.”\n",

    "---\n",

    "### “What Are Your Strengths and Weaknesses?”\n",

    "“One of my strengths is persistence in solving complex technical problems. During my thesis, I repeatedly refined the architecture and ran multiple experiments until achieving stable performance improvements.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Weakness (Safe & Professional)\n",
